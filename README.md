# Notion Controller

This is a passion project that I created to automate and amplify my usage of [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - the note-taking software platform.

## Overview

### The problem

As a power user of notion, I have noticed many limitations in the current version (at the time of writing) of the software. Some of which include clunky multi-page navigation (especially mobile), minimal horizontal layout capabilities and minimal automation opportunities.

I wanted to create a controller that allowed me to tackle some of these problems. As I use Notion every day, I've designed this project to be long term so that I can add functionality for different use-cases over time.

The first use-case I designed for was related to my habit of going to the gym. Every session at the gym, I write down each exercise that I do, how many reps/sets I do and at what weight. Before the solution, I would screenshot the previous session's entry (correlated to the muscle group, e.g. previous cardio session), create a new entry, and write in each exercise as I did them. I would also then refer to the screenshot to see if I increased my weight/rep amount from the previous session and what exercise to do next. This process was very manual and was frustrating due to the clunky navigation.

I wanted a solution where I could tap one button and a new page would be created with pre-filled data from the previous week's correlated session. I wanted this solution to be via my phone as I don't have my computer at the gym.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to take advantage of SCSS' useful nesting and variable features. 

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to be able to implement SCSS syntax faster and more accurately. I would also like to be able to incorporate mixins throughout. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Referemnce](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/) - W3Schools helped me a lot as it was my main reference for css syntax
